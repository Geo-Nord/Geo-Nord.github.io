1. **GPS Maze Adventures, what is that?** The Maze is a very rare event type
   cache. The Maze will offer you to immerse yourself in the history of
   geocaching through a playful maze. During the visit of the exhibition,
   participate in the activities, solve riddles and don’t miss the opportunity
   to find the 10 special Maze Labcaches.

2. **What can we found in this maze?** Explanatory panels on the types of
   caches, information on trackables, how to make a “night-cache”, learn about
   T5 caches in complete safety, interactive elements… everything you always
   wanted to know about Geocaching!

3. **Will we get the “GPS Maze” cache icon after visiting the exhibition?** Yes,
   for the first time in France, this icon will be assigned to you after you
   have logged your “Attended” on the GPS Maze listing.

4. **Do I need anything to visit the exhibition?** No, just a little patience to
   get in line before you can access the Maze.

5. **Will there be labcaches?** Yes, 10 labcaches will be available inside the
   exhibition in addition to those of the MEGA.

6. **The exhibition will be in French only?** No, most of the information will
   be in French but some panels will also be translated into English. For
   non-French-speaking people, you can buy a book/guide in English at the
   entrance of the exhibition.

7. **When can we visit the exhibition?** The exhibition will be open from
   Wednesday 13 to Sunday 17 July 2022. See the listing for opening hours.
